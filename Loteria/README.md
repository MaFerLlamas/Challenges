# La Lotería

This is my solution to the challenge _**La Lotería**_

## Description
La Lotería is a game in which you choose _**C**_ different numbers
in a range from _**1**_ to _**K**_

The usual lottery has _**C=6**_ and _**K=49**_.
in a random, is chosen _**C**_ a set of numbers that are between the range _**1-K**_.
So the winner is the person who hit the more quantity of numbers
compared with the random set.

For use of the probabilistics is required to get the number or numbers that is
less repeated in a set of betting cases. 

## Entry
The entry have several test cases.  
The First line of every test case have 3 numbers.  
we will name them:  
**N** = _The amount of bets (a set of numbers)._  
**C** = _The quantity of numbers that make a bet._  
**K** = _The maximum Range that is permitted in every number that conforms a bet_  

There are some rules for this numbers:
+ The amount of bets have to be greater than _0_ and less 10001.  
`1<=N<=10000`  
+ The quantity of numbers that make a bet has to be greater than _0_ and less 11.  
`1<=C<=10`


## Output
